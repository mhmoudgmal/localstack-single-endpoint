Localstack single endpoint
---

A simple proxy that tends to understand and analyze aws requests according to [aws docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sigv4-auth-using-authorization-header.html)
to detremine which service is being invoked and forward the request to the corresponding Localstack endpoint.

How to use?
---
#### Docker

- Run the docker container `docker run -p 9000:9000 -e "LOCALSTACK_HOST=172.17.0.2" mhmoudgmal/localstack-single-endpoint` Then you can access localstack using a single endpoint port (9000).

For example invoking a lambda will be the same as for listing the tables in a dynamodb:

- `aws lambda invoke --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000 --function function-name --payload '{}'`
- `aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint-url http://localhost:9000`
